# radius (dark) theme

a custom theme built with the Rockbox theming engine. 
I recently got hooked into the iPod resurgence that has been happening for the past few years and I wanted to finally take on the project of modding my own. I figured I would also load Rockbox onto it and create my own theme for it. The experience was ... something.

What I initially came up with as far as designs was strictly based upon my experience as a web dev and when I took those designs to folks who knew the platform, I was told how limiting it could be. 
Compromises where made and this is what I landed on. 

Since there isnt any type of dynamic positioning like it would be in the browser (ie. elements in a flexbox container), I decided to make it like an old electronics display. In the top status bar there are elements that arent always active like shuffle or the lock, so I made bitmap images to represent the "light" not being on when those features are inactive.

Next I would like to build an Always On screen of sorts and possible a Quick Settings page but for now this should be good enough to get me going.
